# PDF2 Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
PDF2 is a revolutionary document format that embeds structured metadata in PDFs using hidden form fields. This allows for automated data extraction while maintaining full compatibility with existing PDF readers.

## Current Status
✅ Core technology working (creation + extraction)  
✅ Gmail compatibility confirmed  
✅ Chrome PDF viewer compatibility confirmed  

## Phase 1: Core Technology Validation

### Critical Compatibility Testing

- [ ] Android Chrome PDF viewer
- [ ] Adobe Acrobat mobile app

#### Cloud Storage Services
- [ ] Google Drive (upload → download → extract)
